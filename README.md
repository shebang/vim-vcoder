# vim-vcoder

vcoder is a test execution framework for vim. The project has just been started
so there's no real functionality right now besides running a single test for a vim script
via [themis](https://github.com/thinca/vim-themis).

I use vital.vim for managing external dependencies. [![Powered by vital.vim](https://img.shields.io/badge/powered%20by-vital.vim-80273f.svg)](https://github.com/vim-jp/vital.vim)
